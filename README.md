# odin_recipes
this project is about reviewing what i have learnt on the odin project so far
the link i connected to my index.html was not opening in a new tag so i had to go back and add targe=blank and ref=noopener. the link is now opening in a differnt tab.
at the end of the project i would ba able to add linkd within my project and outside my project
i would also be able to add images within my computer and on the web
the web would be well organised as i would put in my tags properly
